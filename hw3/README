hw1: Lorentz Attractor
Ravi Prakash Dubey
CSCI4229/5229 Summer 2018

Changes made for resubmission

1)intensity value was missing from the light position coordinates. Corrected that
2)added support to change the distance of light source from origin with 'o/O'
3)change the leaf construction completely to fixed coordinate based. Normals are correct.


The scene has following objects
1) A model of a leaf
2) an empty plant pot
3) The words "CU" resting on a cylinder with CU logo texture
4) A sphere with earth texture resing on a cone of mettalic texture
5) Mona Lisa Potrait resting on a crate

I have tried to create the Leaf model by getting the coordinates for general leaf shape by intersection of 2 circles. The curves in the leaf cross section have been created by using 1-sin(x)/x function, with the differential of this curve, rotated by 90 degrees, gives the normal for the vertices.

For this scene only orthogonal mode is supported

to build the binary
1)make clean
2)make

to run the binary
1)./hw2

Key bindings  

 'z' cycles through following options
    1. no axes (default)  
    2. axis visible through body of the object

 'n' cycles through the objects of the scene individually

  'v' zoom in - all modes
  'c' zoom out - all modes

  'arrows' Change view angle in orthographic and perspective projection modes

  '0'   Reset to default values

Light Controls

  'l' switch the light source on off
  'm' Toggle  the light source auto rotate
  ',' rotate light source anti clockwise
  '.' rotate light source anti clock wise
  '/' to move light source up
  '?' to move light source down
  'o/O' to move light source closer, further from origin.

  'f/F'  Decrease/increase ambient light
  'g/G'  Decrease/increase diffuse light
  'h/H'  Decrease/increase specular light
  'j/J'  Decrease/increase emitted light
  'k/K'  Decrease/increase shininess

  'ESC' Exit application
