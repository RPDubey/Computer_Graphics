Stretch Goal:
a Basic collision detection and avoidance for first person

For this scene,  orthogonal mode is not supported

to build the binary
1)make clean
2)make

to run the binary
1)./final

Key bindings  

 'z' cycles through following options
    1. no axes (default)  
    2. axis visible through body of the object

 'n' cycles through the objects of the scene individually, starting with whole scene

  'c' zoom out - all modes

  'arrows' Change view angle in perspective projection modes

  'w,s,a,d' for Move ahead/Move back/rotate L/rotate R in first mode person only

  '0'   Reset to default values

  'r' toggle obstacle detection on/off (only in full scene)
  
  't' toggle fog on/off(only in full scene)

  'e' toggle fence view on/off

Light Controls
