Ravi Prakash Dubey
CSCI4229/5229 Summer 2018

The scene has following objects
1) 3 sets of Table and Chairs
2) 3 sets of lamp 
3) 2 plant pots(without plant) - drawn using cone
4) 2 decorative pieces composed of solid cylinder,cone and sphere

for first person perspective, Motion is restricted to x-z plane only. Motion is also bound within 'DIM' dimensions. However, I havent yet figured how to restrict motion around complex objects. 


to build the binary
1)make clean
2)make

to run the binary
1)./hw2

Key bindings  

 'z' cycles through following options
    1. no axes (default)  
    2. axis visible through body of the object

 'x' cycles through following mode options
    1. orthographic projection(default)
    2. perspective projection
    3. first person projection

  'v' zoom in - all modes
  'c' zoom out - all modes

  'arrows' Change view angle in orthographic and perspective projection modes
  
  navigation in first person projection mode:

  'w' move forward in first person  projection 
  's' move backward in first person  projection
  'a' rotate view anticlockwise in first person  projection
  'd' rotate view clockwise in first person  projection

  '0'   Reset to default values
  
  'ESC' Exit application
